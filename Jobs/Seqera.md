## Prev experience with nextflow
- Built [tmerge analysis pipeline](https://github.com/jacobwindsor/tmerge-analysis-pipeline) using DSL2
	- [tmerge2](https://github.com/jacobwindsor/tmerge)
- Gave presentation to my team on nextflow

## Initial interview with Cyn
[cynthia.benitez@seqera.io](cynthia.benitez@seqera.io)

- Went well
- Said they may be able to find a job specifically for me

## Notes from talks
### Visualiztion of DAG 
- Useful to have a visualization of the process of a pipeline along the DAG
- For tower
- I like these kind of UIs
	- Think of some ideas

## Nextflow schema
- Used to generate a form for a non-dev to fill in parameters to run the pipeline through nextflow tower
- **Have a look at the docs for this**
- How are these forms generated?
	- How is the validation done?
- Very similiar to what we're doing at HCA
